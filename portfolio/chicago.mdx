Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.

- **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.
- **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.

Importantly, Next.js lets you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.

2 variables need some clarifications:
- `rideable_type` has are 3 possible values: `classic_bike`, `docked_bike` and `electric_bike`.
- `member_casual` has 2 possible values, `casual`or `member`. Casual riders have bought either a single ride or a day pass (unlimited 3-hour rides for 24-hour); while Members have subscribed for an annual membership (unlimited 45-minute rides with a classic bike, then an extra $0.17/min).

```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(ride_id) AS number_of_records,
  COUNT(DISTINCT ride_id) AS unique_ride,
  COUNTIF(rideable_type IS NOT NULL) AS rideable_records,
  COUNTIF(started_at IS NOT NULL) AS started_at_records,
  COUNTIF(ended_at IS NOT NULL) AS ended_at_records,
  COUNTIF(member_casual IS NOT NULL) AS member_records
FROM `data-portfolio-379214.divvy_dataset.2022_tripdata`
```

Then I wanted to learn more about the differences between `classic_bike` and `docked_bike` since there are, according to Divvy website, only 2 types of bikes: classic and electric.
