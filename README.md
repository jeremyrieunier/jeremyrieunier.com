This is my personal data analyst portfolio where I'll share my work and document my learning.

## Features
#### Home page
The home page should quickly say who I am and what I do. Then it should display posts and projects in reverse chronological order.

#### Markdown support
I want to write articles and analyses using Markdown files. I might add some custom components in the future, like charts and visualization.

#### Posts subfolders
I want all my posts under a `/posts` subfolder in reverse chronological order.

#### Portfolio subfolder
I want all my data analysis projects under a `/portfolio` subfolder in reverse chronological order.
